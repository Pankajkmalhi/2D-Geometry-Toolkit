###Convex Hull and Line Intersection Algorithms
Welcome to the Convex Hull and Line Intersection Algorithms project! This repository includes two Python scripts: #convex_hull.py and #line_intersection.py. These scripts are designed to provide functionalities related to convex hull computation and line segment intersection detection in a 2D plane.
#Convex Hull (convex_hull.py)
Dependencies
Python 3.0
Tkinter (required for the GUI in the PointGeneratorApp class)
How to Run
Execute the convex_hull.py script in your terminal using the following command:
#python convex_hull.py
##Usage
#Click on the "Generate Random Points" button to populate the canvas with random points.
#Choose a convex hull algorithm from the available options: Brute Force, Jarvis March, Graham Scan, Quick Elimination, or Monotone Chain.
#The canvas will dynamically display the convex hull in red, and the algorithm's execution time will be showcased prominently.
##Line Intersection (line_intersection.py)
#Dependencies
Python 3.0
Matplotlib
NumPy
memory-profiler
How to Run
Run the line_intersection.py script with the following command:
##python line_intersection.py
##Usage
Input the coordinates for two line segments when prompted.
Choose a method for detecting line intersection: CCW (Counter-Clockwise), Slope, or Vector.
The script will generate a visual plot showcasing the two line segments, with a clear indication of whether they intersect.
Feel free to explore, contribute, and customize these scripts according to your needs. Happy coding!
