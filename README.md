echo "# Convex Hull and Line Intersection Algorithms  \n\nThis project includes two Python scripts: \`convex_hull.py\` and \`line_intersection.py\`. The \`convex_hull.py\` script implements several algorithms for finding the convex hull of a set of points on a 2D plane. The \`line_intersection.py\` script, on the other hand, focuses on determining whether two line segments intersect.  \n\n## Convex Hull (\`convex_hull.py\`)  \n\n### Dependencies  \n\n- Python 3.x  \n- Tkinter (for the GUI in the \`PointGeneratorApp\` class)  \n\n### How to Run  \n\nRun the script by executing the following command in the terminal:  \n\n\`\`\`bash  \npython convex_hull.py  \n\`\`\`  \n\n### Usage  \n\n- Click the \"Generate Random Points\" button to create a set of random points on the canvas.  \n- Choose a convex hull algorithm from the available options: Brute Force, Jarvis March, Graham Scan, Quick Elimination, or Monotone Chain.  \n- The algorithm's execution time will be displayed on the canvas, and the convex hull will be drawn in red.  \n\n## Line Intersection (\`line_intersection.py\`)  \n\n### Dependencies  \n\n- Python 3.x  \n- Matplotlib  \n- NumPy  \n- memory-profiler  \n\n### How to Run  \n\nRun the script by executing the following command in the terminal:  \n\n\`\`\`bash  \npython line_intersection.py  \n\`\`\`  \n\n### Usage  \n\n- Input the coordinates of two line segments when prompted.  \n- Choose the method for detecting line intersection: CCW (Counter-Clockwise), Slope, or Vector.  \n- A plot will be displayed showing the two line segments, and it will indicate whether the lines intersect." > README.md
